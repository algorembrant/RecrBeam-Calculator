im planning to make a rectangular beam calculator based on python end-to-end system (from backend calculations, database save statistics, and frontend UI based on python)

features include:
1. i can input the dimensions of the beam and will show up the image of the beam with the dimensions
2.. it solves the missing value by following a mathematical formula
