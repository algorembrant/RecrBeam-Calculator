Teamwork skills

I value team members and help them to elevate their individual skills in managing the team’s workflow, making the project/activity not just for the sake of completion, but also a way to improve oneself and everybody on the team.
No, I do not explain complicated stuff such as handling APIs, backend, database, and frontend (because we can just talk about it later).
I prioritize shipping the solution to the problem rather than being a nerdy one.
